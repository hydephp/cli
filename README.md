## About

This is an experimental standalone executable for the static site generator HydePHP.

With this global binary, you can use the HydePHP CLI to generate quality static sites faster than ever before!

### âš  Beta software notice

Please note that the standalone HydePHP version is **experimental**, and that there may be breaking changes and bugs until the 1.0 release.
- In the meantime, you may want to use the standard HydePHP project: https://github.com/hydephp/hyde

## Installation

### Using Composer <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/hyde/cli"><img alt="Total Installs on Packagist" src="https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/hyde/cli?label=installs" align="right"></a>

```bash
composer global require hyde/cli
```

Make sure to place the Composer system-wide vendor bin directory in your `$PATH` so the `hyde` executable can be located by your system. This directory is typically located at `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`.

### Direct Download (Unix) <a href="https://github.com/hydephp/cli/releases/latest"><img alt="Total Installs on GitHub" src="https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/hydephp/cli/total.svg" align="right"></a>

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hydephp/cli/releases/latest/download/hyde -o hyde
chmod +x hyde && sudo mv hyde /usr/local/bin/hyde
```

### Docker (Highly Experimental)

> [!WARNING]
> The HydePHP CLI Docker image is under development and is highly experimental. Proceed with caution and report the bugs you will certainly encounter.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/hydephp/cli:latest
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/hydephp/cli:latest <command>
```

Using the Docker image allows you to run the HydePHP CLI without installing any other dependencies like PHP or Composer on your local machine.

If you want to use the HydePHP CLI Docker image as a global command, you can create a shell alias:

```bash
alias hyde='docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app ghcr.io/hydephp/cli:latest'
```

## Usage

```bash
# List available commands
hyde

# Create a new full HydePHP project
hyde new

# Build a site using source files in the working directory
hyde build
```
